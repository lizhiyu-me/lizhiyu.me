## Hello world and brief self introduction. 😁

Very glad to meet you on Hashnode. My english name is Steffan Lee, a father👨‍👩‍👧, a rider🚴🏻 who make web games by React and Three.js from China.

- 👨🏻‍🦱**lizhiyu**, my Chinese name in Pinyin, the pronunciation annotation for Chinese.
- 🍰**lycheefish**,  my nickname,  which speak the same as my Chinese name pronounciation ，maybe it's a delicious food.

I always believe in a Chinese proverb, "Give away what you have earned and teach what you have learned", so I decide to share my study and experiecne once a week at least, maybe it's not the best, but wish to help people who need. 

Make valuable things, make people happy.

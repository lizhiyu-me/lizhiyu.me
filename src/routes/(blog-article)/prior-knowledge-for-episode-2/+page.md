     not played a single card, it is spring.
   - Anti-Spring: After the landlord plays the first hand of cards, the farmer
     controls it, and until the farmer finishes playing the hand, the landlord
     has not played a card, that is, the anti-spring.
   - Double: After confirming the landlord again, both the landlord and the
     peasant can freely choose to double or not to double, and if they choose to

   - The system randomly selects a player to call the landlord first, and then
     the other 2 will grab the landlord or not.
   - When calling the landlord, you can choose not to call or call the landlord.
     After someone calls the landlord, you can rob the landlord. Call the
     landlord multiples of 1, 2, and 3 times, and the first to grab 3 times is
     the landlord.
   - After confirming the landlord, the three hole cards are shown and the
     landlord gets the last three hole cards.
   - In the card playing stage, when it is your turn to press the card, you can
     freely choose not to play or play a higher card than the previous player.
   - The game ends when any farmer player finishes playing cards, and 2 peasants
     win. If the landlord have finished playing cards, the game ends and the
     landlord wins.

Fighting the Landlord itself is a strategic game. As a landlord, you must
understand the advantages of your three cards. As a farmer, when your own
advantages are insufficient, you must choose to cooperate in a group.
Opportunity to defeat the landlord to win.

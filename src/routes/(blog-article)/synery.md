## Combine your computers with Synergy

I used to code on my Mac, but Mac run game engine editor so bad. So I have to work on two computers, one for coding, one for game engine for some game scene.
It's not convenient especially code and edit game scene in the same time.

Synergy give me the answer, it's awsome.
